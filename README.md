# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Plant diseases cause major loss in agriculture.  
This project uses **Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras** to detect plant leaf diseases from images automatically.

The system classifies leaf images into **healthy or diseased** categories, helping in early detection and prevention.
